#### [Supply Chain Demand Analysis: Optimizing Warehouse Inventory and Forecasting Key Product Trends]
[<img src="./images/cover.png?raw=true"/>]

### Goal
The goal of this project is to analyze the demand distribution across warehouses and inventory management practices. The primary focus is on Warehouse J, which exhibits significantly higher demand than other warehouses. Understanding the demand patterns for various products and predicting future trends will enable better inventory management and strategic planning.

### Define the Business problem
In the real world, many businesses face challenges with inventory imbalances across their supply chain, which can lead to stockouts, excess inventory, and inefficiencies in distribution. This problem is particularly critical when demand is not evenly distributed across warehouses, and inventory allocation strategies are not optimized.

### Dateset
The dataset “Forecasts for Product Demand”[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/felixzhao/productdemandforecasting] is used from Kaggle. The dataset includes historical product demand for a global manufacturing company offering thousands of products across various categories. With four central warehouses managing regional shipments, products are often manufactured worldwide, requiring over a month for ocean freight delivery.

### EDA
Through exploratory data analysis, the following insights were discovered:
[]
- **Warehouse J**: Has a demand volume of approximately 3.36 billion, making it the primary distribution center. Its demand is significantly higher than other warehouses.
- **Warehouse S** and **Warehouse C**: These warehouses have intermediate demand, with total sales of approximately 1.03 billion and 580 million, respectively.
- **Warehouse A**: Has the lowest demand at 160 million, suggesting that it may be a smaller or regional warehouse with lower demand.
[]
Furthermore, **Warehouse J** shows high demand across most product types, with significant seasonal fluctuations in demand, particularly for **Product_1359** and **Product_1248**.

### Conclusion

This analysis confirms that **Warehouse J** is the primary distribution hub, driven largely by two key products with strong seasonal demand patterns.

- **Product_1359** peaks in **January, October, and November**, averaging over **40 million units**, likely due to seasonal or promotional demand.
- **Product_1248** shows a significant spike in **July**, with demand approaching **30 million units**, indicating a summer-driven surge.

Accurate forecasting of these products is essential to prevent stockouts and ensure inventory readiness during peak periods. By aligning inventory strategies with demand trends, businesses can reduce supply chain risks, improve service levels, and enhance operational efficiency.
